Title: Natural Rate of Interest
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jannes Reddig
Maintainer: Jannes Reddig <jreddig1@gmail.com>
Description: rStar calculates the natural rate of interest based on the Holsten-Laubach-Williams technique Holsten, Laubach, and Williams (2017).
    It takes a data file with the quarterly values of: log of real GDP (Index or Values), the inflation rate, the nominal interest rate,and the inflation expectations (which are calculated as the average inflation over the last 4 quarters including the current quarter). 
    You might need to install mFilter manually from its archive. 
    You are welcome to use your own datasets, but it is likely to give you a singular error matrix. Rather use the built in functions for the US or South Africa. More countries to be added soon.
